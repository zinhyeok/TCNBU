\title{Generate Change-point Dendrogram}
\usage{
cpdendrogram(
  y,
  BEresult,
  startMax = TRUE,
  flat = TRUE,
  shortLabel = FALSE,
  title = "change-point dendrogram"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A n x d matrix to be scanned with n observations and d dimensions.}

\item{BEresult}{Detailed result list returned by \code{\link{gBE}}.}

\item{startMax}{If the change-point dendrogram starting from the position where goodness-of-fit statistic is maximized.}

\item{flat}{If the height of nodes are set to be at least the height of their children.}

\item{shortLabel}{If the dendrogram only shows starting points of intervals.}

\item{title}{Title of the change-point dendrogram.}
}
\description{
Plotting a change-point dendrogram according to the result of graph-based backward elimination.
